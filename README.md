# IssAssist (ALPHA STAGE)
IssAssist is a core module to bring AI and ML in to your daily IT Operation.
We just started up this project and we hope to soon announced our first Alpha version where you can upgrade all your Linux systems.

## Ideas
We have millions of idea with this and we will develop multiple plugins where we do cleaver stuff before an operation is happening, like...

* Have your system been updated in a wild?
* Before Upgrade have your system been backed up?
* Including a Chatbot that notify you on Slack that a system update will happening in the next 24 hours should it continue or do you want to pause it?
* It has come up critical updated, do you want to deploy does right away or schedule that update?
* Chatbot that will help your co-worker to know you are part of a meeting and can help them instead.
* Text / Voice Explanation for "Infrastructure as Code" to create a Terraform script by asking questions.

## IssSys
IssSys is our first open source module that will collect update status for all your servers.
Here can you either push data from your own applications package software or use our open source version called IssSys.
